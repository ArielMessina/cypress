Regression Exercise: 

In order to ensure that new changes to the system do not introduce any unintended consequences or break existing functionality. Here's an outline of a regression testing plan that could be enacted upon new builds of the system. To do so, We need to:

1- Test all existing test cases, based on previous builds
2- Create new test cases to test new builds.
3- Mantainance: 
	a- Update and fix any broken automated scenario
	b- Update and fix any outdated manual scenario
4- Once updated, the automated test suite will be executed to be integrated with the deployment pipeline.
5- An example of the previous step will be executing the whole regression test suite after the deployment has finished.
